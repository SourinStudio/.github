<p align="center">We build cool things for Minecraft and the web — calm, clean, and a bit chaotic.</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>
  SourinStudio is an indie team creating tools and experiences for Minecraft players and communities.<br>
  We set up custom servers, build plugins and mods, and explore fun side projects along the way.<br>
  Our work blends creativity and calm energy — whether it's a useful admin tool or something chaotic just for fun.

  Minecraft plugins and modded features<br>
  Web dashboards and tools for server admins<br>
  Experimental mechanics and mini-games<br>
  Custom Minecraft server setups (Paper, Spigot, Fabric)

<h3>Our Style</h3>

  Simple. Purposeful. Fun.<br>
  Everything is crafted with clean and thoughtful code.
